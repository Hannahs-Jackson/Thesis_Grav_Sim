_**Abstract:** A numerical analysis was conducted upon a series of protostellar star-disk systems using a 1st order perturbation method to evaluate the self-gravitating coupling effects that a spatially resolved protostar core and its accretion disk have upon one another. The system’s geometric features were parameterized according to the inner and outer edge of the accretion disk along the rotational plane and the polar and equatorial radii of the protostar core. Additionally, the mass ratio of the protostar core and its accretion disk was parameterized. A series of computational models were run for a series of disk variants and cross analyzed with a series of star variants to explore how those parameters effected the likely dominant system pattern and modal type. The system’s energy distribution between rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy was found to be
strongly correlated to the parameters of the protostar core while the location of the perturbation’s radius of corotation strongly depended upon both its azimuthal symmetry number and the accretion disk’s geometric parameters._
